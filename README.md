    * **For Node.js (React/Angular/Vue/etc.):**
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        yarn start
        ```
        (This usually opens the project in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` or similar.)
    * **For Python (Django/Flask):**
        ```bash
        python manage.py runserver
        ```
        (For Django)
        ```bash
        flask run
        ```
        (For Flask)
    * **[Add specific run commands for your project type]**

* **To run tests:**
    * **For Node.js:**
        ```bash
        npm test
        ```
        or

        or
        ```bash
        python manage.py test
        ```
    * **[Add specific test commands]**

* **To build for production (if applicable):**
    * **For Node.js:**
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
        or
